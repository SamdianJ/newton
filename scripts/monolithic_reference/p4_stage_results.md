# P4 stage results and commit policy

Complete each independently reviewable phase or subtask, run its applicable checks, and commit its code, tests, and result summary on `SamiulJ/monolithic-refactor` before starting the next phase. Reference external evidence by path and SHA-256. Keep unrelated edits, large recordings, caches, and environments out of commits. Do not push without separate authorization. A blocked or unfinished phase is not complete.

## T0a–T0c: baseline admission

These phases were completed together before the per-phase commit rule was introduced and are committed as one T0 batch. Solver implementations are unchanged. The frozen P3 source remains `39f80c48da2022187823f8218131a249807597a0` in the integration checkout.

- Freeze source/input identities, API contracts, test discovery and migration candidates.
- Add an isolated parameterized Franka baseline driver and complete recording checker.
- Pass nine Franka trajectories: 47,250 steps, 47,193 converged, 57 Stopped, no hard failures; all original grasp gates pass.
- Verify and reuse Sharpa: 8,667 steps, 8,637 converged, 30 Stopped; grasp remains uncertified.
- Pass the default driver comparison and eight temporary same-configuration repeat comparisons; freeze per-case numerical envelopes. Remove duplicate temporary trajectories after retaining reports.
- Pass seven tooling tests, CPU/CUDA three-law independent E/r/B and noise checks, and pre-commit. The 8,160 discovered baseline tests were not all executed.

T0 admission allows T1 to start. This is not refactored-solver acceptance or P4 full qualification. The other 44 original matrix cases are deferred. Pairwise envelopes are not statistical confidence bounds; a complete historical package inventory is unavailable.

External evidence is relative to the workspace root containing `worktrees/`, `dev/`, and `agents/`. Large recordings remain outside Git.

## T1: neutral definitions and import isolation

Extract unchanged enums, immutable stats/joint options, calibrated configuration,
and the step exception into `solver_types.py`. Keep existing solver type access.
Resolve the solver and independent collision pipeline lazily; neutral definitions
and collision imports no longer load the historical solver. Move P3 exception
imports to the neutral module. No kernels or solver methods change.

Validation: 37 tests run, 36 passed, one existing CPU mesh-texture skip; the three
new boundary tests fail on the frozen baseline. AST comparison preserves eight
definitions after normalizing docstring indentation and the status annotation,
and preserves every historical solver method/kernel unchanged.
Full trajectories are deferred to the planned later gates.

Remaining: shared joint/tet dependencies belong to T1a/T1b; the transitional
parent chain and old public solver stay until T2. No source is retired yet.

Evidence: `agents/integration/artifacts/p4/t1-v1/receipt.json`, SHA-256
`a551d8e3c754cae5052384a0406630311a2d75a793725e9c2ae4cddf33239e56`.

## T1a: shared joint parameters and target snapshots

Extract scalar layout validation, model parameter freezing, allowed properties,
target mapping/snapshots and the control-validation kernel into
`joint_parameters.py`. P3 uses `JointParameters` without old evaluation buffers.
The historical workspace shares these parameters and retains its own evaluation
and publication methods. FP64 kinematics now imports only the shared validator.
No FK, target arithmetic, E/r/B, or history formula changes.

Validation: 48 tests run, 47 passed, one existing CPU texture skip. Cover CPU/CUDA
parameter and layout rejection, target snapshots, duplicate force rejection,
FK/history/configuration, independent E/r/B and coupled transactions/graphs.
AST checks confirm identical validation, constructor parameter prefix, target
snapshots and input kernel. Two initial test-only CPU shared-view mistakes were
corrected; their failure log is retained.

The component import boundary passes. The historical solver parent chain remains
explicitly deferred to T2; no source files have been retired.
